# If you have to access service via EC2 DNS or IP, go with NodePort :

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: pankaj-test-alpine-ag
  labels:
    app: alpine-ag
spec:
  type: NodePort 
  ports:
  - port: 4200
  selector:
    app: alpine-ag
--- 
# If you will be setting up Ingress further, go with ClusterIP

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: pankaj-test-alpine-ag
  labels:
    app: alpine-ag
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 4200
  selector:
    app: alpine-ag

# Command : kubectl create -f alpine-ag-service.yaml

------

# Once NodePort service is created, get the port from kubectl get svc, go to EC2 and open same port from inbound # rules - saying anywhere, get IP address of EC2 and port, hit from browser - like : http://13.233.227.111:30304/
